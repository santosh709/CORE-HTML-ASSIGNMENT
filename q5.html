             <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>
            Node.js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. <br>
            Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language. <br>
            The Node.js approach offers a major advantage over these models, according to its creator Ryan Dahl. Node does not block input/output (I/O) operations like more traditional approaches.

             <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd>
        Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js designed for building web applications and APIs. <br>
        xpress is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. <br>
        It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes. <br>
        The reason behind creating an express framework for node js is:
         1.Time-efficient
         2.Fast 
         3.Economical
         4.Easy to learn
         5.Asynchronous

        <dt>React.js</dt>
        <dd>
            React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI
            components. <br>
            React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. <br>
            React.js is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. <br>
            React.js is called React because it was designed to respond quickly to user interactions. <br>
            React.js shortExplanation: React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>
            MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs. <br>
            MongoDB has become popular with developers in part due to the its intuitive API, flexible data model, and features that include: <br>
            MongoDB supports field, range, and regular-expression queries which can return entire documents, specific fields of documents, or random samples of results. <br>
            Fields in a MongoDB document can be indexed with primary and secondary indices. MongoDB supports a number of different index types, including single field, compound (multiple fields), multikey (array), geospatial, text, and hashed. <br>
            MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets including two or more copies of the data. Writes are handled by the primary replica, while any replica is capable of serving read requests. If the primary replica fails, a secondary replica is promoted to become the primary replica.

        <dt>MY SQL</dt>
        <dd>
            MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns. <br>
            MySQL is based on Structured Query Language (SQL). <br>
            MySQL is used for a wide range of purposes, including: Data warehousing, E-commerce, Logging applications, Web databases. <br>
